This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

#playing with models
openai challenges => cant perform embedding because of free tier limit 3/min. to tackle this im gonna make the chunksize high and limit to 3 not good at all but to test its enough.

chatgpt model using cosine and transformer im trying dot product and cosine for similarites.
vector dimension of text-ada open ai model is 1536, so need to update pinecone db;

By using transformers i can use the "Xenova/e5-large-v2" model and its dimensions is 1024 so need to change the pinecone config.

pinecone migrated from 0 to 1v so things changes including namespace not available for free tier so need to use some filter across the meta data.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
